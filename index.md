## About me
I'm wokring as an AI engineer at [Innovation Center](icenter.ai) of VNPT-IT. I earned M.S in Electrical Engineering from school of [Electrical Engineering](ee.kaist.ac.kr) at [KAIST](kaist.ac.kr). My supervisor at KAIST was Prof. Chang Dong Yoo in [AIM Lab](slsp.kaist.ac.kr). 

After completing master degree, I returned to Vietnam and started my current position at VNPT-IT from 15/06/2020. I'm interesting in:
* __scence understading__ : understanding scene in static images by building a scene graph from the image and their pair-wise relationships. 
* __image generation__ : generating high quality output images from a structured input, e.g a scene graph. 

My graduation thesis is "*Scene Graph Generation with Attended Predicate Prediction*" which merely uses a simple yet effective attention module to archive comparable performance with state-of-the-arts in predicting relationships between pairs of given objects.
